## Movivation[](#motivation)
My purpose for making this game is my memories of playing this game with my friends in school, and I want to build this game because I think this is a more manageable size game since this is my first game. Also I think this will be a good project because it will show my comprehension of pygame.

## Controls[](#controls)
The controls are simple for movement WASD. 
- W will move you forward
- S will move you back
- A will move you left
- D will move you right

Shooting
- Spacebar 

Lives
- If an enemy ship hits you 1 life will be lost. Once all 3 are gone the game will be over.

Power-up
There are 4 power ups. The first one is life which is a heart in a yellow box and this will add 1 heart to the player count. The second is the bomb which is a bomb in a yellow box. Inorder to use this the player will have to press Q and this will shoot a bomb projectile forward. The third is doubleshot which is the ship with two lasers coming from it in the yellow box. In Order to use this the player will have to press E and this will have ten shots with two lasers. The last is the speed boost which is a blue box and this will make your movement speed fast but if you lose a life your speed will be reset.
